Proposal:

We will have a launchscreen displaying the logo and app name, SpotBuddy. The main view will then display the user's current location on a map. We have two created two buttons: one for locating the vehicle's position and the other for updating it. If the latter is chosen, we move to the next view where the user can search for a location to mark his parking spot.
